A command palette for the web. Similar to ctrl+k or ctrl+p in code editors.

It uses

- [alphagov/accessible-autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete) for the UI
- [farzher/fuzzysort](https://github.com/farzher/fuzzysort) to extend it with fuzzy searching.

Development checklist

- list can be browsed with keyboard up/down and selected with enter
- (fuzzy) search input to filter the list
- modal option with global shortcut toggle
- can call arbitrary actions
- is a custom element

For later

- groups of actions?
